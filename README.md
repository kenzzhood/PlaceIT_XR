## üöÄ Overview  
**Problem Statement**  
Shopping online can be challenging, especially when trying to find products that match a space (furniture, d√©cor) or personal preferences (shoes, accessories). Customers struggle with:

* **Visualizing** how a product fits in their environment.  
* **Matching colors and aesthetics** with their surroundings.  
* **Making informed decisions** before purchasing.  

---

## üîç Solution  
PlaceIT XR is a smart AR/VR shopping assistant that:

‚úîÔ∏è **AI-powered search optimization:**
 
User enters the product name. If it's a space-dependent product (like furniture), the user uploads an image of the placement area. A multimodal AI (Gemini) analyzes the space (color scheme, style) and creates an optimized search query. The AI fetches the best-matching results from Google Shopping (top 10-15).

‚úîÔ∏è **3D & AR Integration:**

Users can select a product and visualize it in AR. We web scrape product images and convert them into 3D models using Stable-Fast-3D (running on a server). The generated 3D models are displayed in AR using Unity.

‚úîÔ∏è **VR Real Estate Shopping:**
 
Real estate agents can use our platform to recreate homes/flats in VR. Buyers can browse & place furniture/products inside their VR home before purchasing. Supports Oculus Quest 2 for an immersive experience.

‚úîÔ∏è **Context-Aware AI Chatbot:**
  
A smart AI chatbot helps users find the right product and answers questions. Understands product details, specifications, reviews, and comparisons in real-time. Offers personalized recommendations based on user preferences and search history.

## Usage

### Flutter Frontend

*   *Home Page:* Displays a grid of products with search functionality.
*   *Search:* Use the search bar to find products by keywords or upload an image for image-based search.
*   *Chat Assistant:* Interact with the chat assistant to get product recommendations and answers to shopping-related questions.

### Flask Backend

The Flask server provides the following endpoints:

*   /search: Accepts a search query (text or image) and returns a list of products.
*   /chat: Accepts a user message and returns a response from the shopping assistant.
*   /proxy-image: Proxies images to avoid CORS issues.

## Model Uploading and Downloading

The Model-uploading & Downloading directory contains scripts for uploading and downloading 3D models.

*   server.py: A Python script that interacts with a server (likely running in Colab) to upload images, generate 3D models, and download the generated models.
*   To use this functionality:
    1.  Run the Colab server.
    2.  Obtain the ngrok URL from the Colab server.
    3.  Run server.py and enter the ngrok URL when prompted.
    4.  Enter the path to the image you want to upload.
    5.  The script will upload the image, wait for the model to be generated, and download the model to the current directory.

## Next Steps for the Hackathon

*   Prototype the AI search system using Gemini.
*   Develop a basic AR model viewer using Unity.
*   Create a demo for the VR real estate feature.
